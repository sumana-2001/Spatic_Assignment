# Spatic_Assignment for above Problem Statement 
Assignment for Python Developer 

You are given a dataset which consists of entries with latitude, longitude, and name (link to the dataset file is given below along with some helpful materials).  Your task is to write a Python program that will identify entries which are within 200 meters of each other and have similar names i.e. strings that are similar, but not necessarily same 

For example: 
	Bangalore and Bangaloore
new delhi and NewDelhi

Similarity Criteria:
Similar points should be within 200 meters distance from each other
 Maximum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other should be less than 5

Here are the requirements for the solution:
The program should be written in Python and use appropriate data structures to store the dataset.
Output should be a csv file with all the entries which satisfy given criteria of similarity marked as True / 1 in a separate column named is_similar
Submission files both python program and output csv file should be uploaded to a public github repository

Please submit your solution as a .py file, along with any relevant comments or explanations. The code should be well-documented and easy to understand. Good luck!
Please submit your solutions within 5 days of receiving the assignment.
